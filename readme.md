# SLACK STANDUP BOT


## Run
- run `. env/bin/activate` to get into the virtual environment
- since I edited the slack client, installing requirement may not be a good idea for now.
- replace bot token on `run.py`
- run `python run.py`
- you should be able to interact with your bot now.

## Note
- on going development.
